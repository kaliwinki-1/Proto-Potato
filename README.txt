## 🌌 Overview

Welcome to **LUNA-MYCO-GENESIS**, the world's first open-source initiative dedicated to the agricultural impossibility of farming **Unicorns (Equus monoceros)** on the surface of the **Moon**, specifically using giant, genetically modified space mushrooms as the primary growth vector.

> **⚠️ WARNING:** This project requires a Class 5 Reality Distortion Field. Do not attempt to run this on a standard Newtonian physics engine.

---

## 📊 The Growth Cycle

We use a complex state machine to track the biological evolution from spore to sparkle.

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before you launch your shuttle, ensure you have the following dependencies installed in your reality matrix:

| Dependency | Version | Required Amount | Notes |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :--- |
| **Stardust** | `v4.2.0` | 500kg | Must be gathered from the trailing edge of a comet. |
| **Hope** | `latest` | ∞ | Do not use the deprecated 'Despair' library. |
| **Cheese** | `Gouda` | 1 Wheel | The moon is made of it; bring extra for patching holes. |
| **Flux Capacitor** | `1.21GW` | 1 | For time-traveling back to fix your mistakes. |

## 💾 Installation

To deploy the fungal colony, copy the following incantation into your terminal. **Do not read it aloud**, or you may summon a developer advocate.

```bash
# Clone the repository into your subconscious
git clone [https://github.com/nasa/top-secret/unicorn-farm.git](https://github.com/nasa/top-secret/unicorn-farm.git)

# Install cosmic dependencies
npm install star-dust --save-dev
npm install magic-wand -g

# Initialize the lunar surface
sudo terraform apply -var="gravity=0.16" -var="atmosphere=false"

# Plant the seeds
run-sequence inject-mycelium --target="Sea of Tranquility"
```

---

## 🧬 Configuration Variables

Adjust your `cosmos.env` file to optimize horn length and mane fluffiness.

```json
{
  "atmosphere_composition": {
    "oxygen": "1%",
    "glitter": "99%"
  },
  "unicorn_settings": {
    "color_palette": ["#FF00FF", "#00FFFF", "#FFFF00"],
    "temperament": "Sassy",
    "can_fly": true,
    "diet": ["Dreams", "Cotton Candy", "C++ Pointers"]
  },
  "mushroom_host": {
    "species": "Amanita Muscaria Galactica",
    "size": "Gigantic"
  }
}
```

## 🚀 Advanced Protocols

<details>
<summary><strong>CLICK TO EXPAND: Protocol 88 - The Rainbow Injection</strong></summary>

### The Rainbow Injection
If your mushrooms are refusing to sprout horns, you must initiate the **Prism Overdrive**.

1. Align your satellite dish to the constellation **Monoceros**.
2. Play *Dark Side of the Moon* in reverse.
3. Execute the following function:

```javascript
function injectRainbows(mushroom) {
    const intensity = Math.random() * 1000;
    if (intensity > 900) {
        return new Unicorn({ type: 'Legendary', sparkle: true });
    } else {
        console.log("Just a regular horse with a cone glued on.");
        return null;
    }
}
```

### 👾 Space Pests
Watch out for **Moon Crabs**. They love eating unicorn hooves because they taste like marshmallow.
* **Defense:** Loud 90s Eurodance music.
* **Weapons:** Laser pointers (unicorns love them, crabs find them confusing).

## ❓ Frequently Asked Absurdities

**Q: My unicorn is transparent. Is this a bug?**
> A: No, you accidentally enabled `ALPHA_CHANNEL: TRUE`. Feed it ectoplasm to fix it.

**Q: Can I grow unicorns on Mars?**
> A: Technically yes, but they turn red and get very angry. 

**Q: Help! My mushroom grew a human face!**
> A: That is Gary. Gary is the lead developer. Please do not harvest Gary.

## 📉 Known Issues

* **Bug #102:** Sometimes the unicorns grow two heads. This is a feature, not a bug.
* **Bug #345:** Gravity failure causes unicorns to float away into deep space.
* **Error 404:** Unicorn Mane Not Found. Usually occurs when using cheap glitter.
