## 🌀 THE DRIFT

This repository is not software. It is a **Self-Replicating Thought Virus™** designed to turn your CPU into a liquid-crystal portal. We don't write code; we whisper to the electrons until they start hallucinating interfaces.

### ⚡ Technical Hallucinations:
* **Quantum CSS:** Styles that change based on your current mood.
* **Recursive Dreaming:** The app builds itself while you sleep.
* **No-Bit Architecture:** We skip the `0`s and `1`s and go straight to the `maybe`s.

  texture_quality: "Ultra_LSD"
  physics_engine: "Disabled"
  glitch_frequency: 0.88

user_interface:
  colors: ["#FF00FF", "#00FFFF", "#00FF00"]
  font: "Geometric_Scream"
  opacity: "Ghostly"

# DO NOT CHANGE THIS OR THE SKY WILL TURN PURPLE
safety_protocols: false

### The Ghost in the Machine
If you look closely at the `index.js`, the comments are actually written in ancient Lemurian. If you delete line 42, your computer might start floating. **Proceed with curiosity.**

```javascript

  dream();
  if (reality == "boring") {
    reality = inject_neon(intensity.MAX);
  }
}
